# Scrape house.gov and senate.gov for current committee membership,
# and updates the committees-current.yaml file with metadata including
# name, url, address, and phone number.

# Data Sources:
#   House:
#     http://clerk.house.gov/xml/lists/MemberData.xml
#   Senate:
#     https://www.senate.gov/general/committee_membership/committee_memberships_{thomas_id}.xml

# Data Files Updated:
#   committee-membership-current.yaml:
#     All entries are overwritten except for house members of joint committees
#     which have to be manually entered since there is no source of this data
#   committees-current.yaml:
#     Fro House committees, updates name, address, and phone
#     For Senate committees, updates name and url
